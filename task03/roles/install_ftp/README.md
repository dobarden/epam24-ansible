Role Name
=========

The role installs the FTP Server, opens 20-21/TCP ports, and makes writable directory /var/ftp/pub/upload.

Requirements
------------

CentOS on target hosts.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
